        content: 'We have a fixed 2.1% daily interest, so how can we sustain such high interest?. To understand, please read carefully: You are getting (tokens) X (price) = (value of new tokens) <– that is how you get more money. So as long as there is no OVER-SELLING, the value of your new tokens keep its value. And since we have a ACM (Anti-Crash Mechanism), this allows all new tokens to stay valuable. Possibly at some point there will be (DIPS) where your tokens will lower in value, but in the end it will be (CIRCULATING SUPPLY) X (PRICE)=(MARKET CAP) X % of supply you own=your wealth. And because we burn a LOT of the supply, we keep reducing circulating supply to further increase the value of your coins. Our unique ACM technology is what makes this rebase token the very best in the market, and MAXIMIZES your chance to become a millionaire like no other.',
